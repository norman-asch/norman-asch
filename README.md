All property copyright owned by Norman Asch - but feel free to peruse my code! Just a little something for my photo-organising scripts.

# I decided it was time to learn to code when I had trouble finding simple software for organising my photos for my studio, Norman Asch Photography.
# I thought that everything you could imagine would have been created by now - and maybe it has and I just can't find it!
# Or maybe this slightly arrogant ex-New Yorker just wanted an excuse to show the world he's more than just a photographer...

# PHP 5.5+ required
# Place in root directory. Script will automatically create /jpegs and subdirectories as needed
